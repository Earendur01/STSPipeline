# STSPipeline
This project processes raw molecular profiling data from pediatric soft tissue sarcomas (STS). It parses and annotates gene fusions, somatic and germline mutations, and CNVs (copy number variants), generating structured datasets and graphical outputs to support translational and genomic insights.
